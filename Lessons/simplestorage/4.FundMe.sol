    ====== Notes ======
    - This contract implements a crowdfunding mechanism where anyone can send ETH
      as long as it's worth at least $5 (using live Chainlink price feed).
    - The price feed address is for Sepolia testnet; change for other networks.
    - No withdraw() logic or owner features are implemented yet.
    - This is demo code â€” for production, add access control and test thoroughly.
